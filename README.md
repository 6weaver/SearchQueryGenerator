# SearchQueryGenerator
I have used the versatility of Google Sheets in order to create a link generator, in order to use with my web crawling.

The input is a list of companies name, products, supply chain logistics and the list will spit out results for all big search engines.

Furthermore, in order to be fully versatile, a wildcard field has been added, which you may use to search the previous companies on Wikipedia for example, as the main link remains the same.

Another useful function is the ability to add keywords at the end of the query in order to narrow the information you would like.
